	<p id = "history"> "Manchester united was formed in 1878 under the name Newton Heath LYR Football Club. The team initially played games against other departments 
	and rail companies. Alex Ferguson and his assistant Archie Knox arrived from Aberdeen on the day of Atkinson's dismissal, and guided the club 
	to an 11th-place finish in the league. Despite a second-place finish in 1987-88, the club was back in 11th place the following season. Reportedly 
	on the verge of being dismissed, victory over Crystal Palace in the 1990 FA Cup Final replay (after a 3-3 draw) saved Ferguson's career. The 
	following season, Manchester United claimed its first Cup Winners' Cup title and competed in the 1991 UEFA Super Cup, beating European Cup holders Red 
	Star Belgrade 1-0 in the final at Old Trafford. A second consecutive League Cup final appearance followed in 1992, in which the team beat Nottingham 
	Forest 1-0 at Wembley. In 1993, the club won its first league title since 1967, and a year later, for the first time since 1957, it won a second 
	consecutive title - alongside the FA Cup - to complete the first "Double" in the club's history. Manchester United won the league again in the 1999-2000 
	and 2000-01 seasons. The team finished third in 2001-02, before regaining the title in 2002-03. They won the 2003-04 FA Cup, beating Millwall 3-0 in 
	the final at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. In the 2005-06 season, Manchester United failed to qualify for the knockout phase of thediv UEFA Champions
	League for the first time in over a decade, but recovered to secure a second-place league finish and victory over Wigan Athletic in the 2006 Football 
	League Cup Final. The club regained the Premier League in the 2006-07 and 2007-08 seasons, and completed the European double by beating Chelsea 6-5 on 
	penalties in the 2008 UEFA Champions League Final in Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium. Ryan Giggs made a record 759th appearance for the club in this game, 
	overtaking previous record holder Bobby Charlton. In December 2008, the club won the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup and followed this with the 2008-09 
	Football League Cup, and its third successive Premier League title. That summer, Cristiano Ronaldo was sold to Real Madrid for a world record 
	Â£80 million. In 2010, Manchester United defeated Aston Villa 2-1 at Wembley to retain the League Cup, its first successful defence of a knockout cup 
	competition. After finishing as runner-up to Chelsea in the 2009-10 season, United achieved a record 19th league title in 2010-11, securing the 
	championship with a 1-1 away draw against Blackburn Rovers on 14 May 2011. This was extended to 20 league titles in 2012-13, securing the championship 
	with a 3-0 home win against Aston Villa on 22 April 2013." <a href ="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.#Ferguson_years_.281986.E2.80.932013.29"> Wikipedia </a> </p>
